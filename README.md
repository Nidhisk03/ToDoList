ToDoList | A Reactjs App

Its a ToDoList where we can add and delete the elements in list.
Here Firstly I had Created three components 
1) App - It just maps all the list items in the list and display it on the browser
2) Input - It takes the input from the user and then store it in a list
3) ToDoitem - It is used for displaying the elements which user had added to the todolist after user had clicked it

And here i had use use state to store the the elements present in the list.

Here to setup this project we just need to to
1) cd list
2)Then you just need to install all the modules using npm install
3)Then you just need to do npm start
